SPLINE curve (`DXF Reference`_), all coordinates have to be 3D coordinates even the spline is only a 2D planar curve.

The spline curve is defined by control points, knot values and weights. The control points establish the spline,
the various types of knot vector determines the shape of the curve and the weights of rational splines define how
strong a control point influences the shape.

To create a :class:`Spline` curve you just need a bunch of fit points - knot values and weights are optional
(tested with AutoCAD 2010). If you add additional data, be sure that you know what you do.

Since *ezdxf* v0.8.9 :class:`Spline` stores fit- and control points, knots and weights as packed data
(:class:`array.array`).
