Classes Section
===============

The CLASSES section in DXF files holds the information for application-defined classes whose instances appear in
:class:`~ezdxf.layouts.Layout` objects. As usual package user there is no need to bother about CLASSES.

.. module:: ezdxf.sections.classes

.. class:: ClassesSection

    .. attribute:: classes

        Storage of all :class:`~ezdxf.entities.DXFClass` objects, they are not stored in the entities database, because
        CLASS has no handle attribute.

    .. attribute:: dxf.instance_count

        Instance count for a custom class.

    .. attribute:: dxf.was_a_proxy

        Set to ``1`` if class was not loaded when this DXF file was created, and ``0`` otherwise.

    .. attribute:: dxf.is_an_entity

        Set to ``1`` if class was derived from the :class:`DXFGraphic` class and can reside in layouts.
        If ``0``, instances may appear only in the OBJECTS section.

    .. attribute:: key

        Unique name as ``(name, cpp_class_name)`` tuple.
