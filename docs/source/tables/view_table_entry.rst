.. module:: ezdxf.entities
    :noindex:

The View table (`DXF Reference`_) stores named views of the model or paperspace layouts. This stored views makes parts
of the drawing or some view points of the model in a CAD applications more accessible. This views have no influence
to the drawing content or to the generated output by exporting PDFs or plotting on paper sheets, they are just for the
convenience of CAD application users.

        32  If both this bit and bit 16 are set, the externally dependent xref has been successfully resolved
        64  If set, the table entry was referenced by at least one entity in the drawing the last time the drawing was
            edited. (This flag is only for the benefit of AutoCAD)
