Spline
======

Render a B-spline as 2D/3D :class:`~ezdxf.entities.Polyline`, can be used with DXF R12. The advantage over
:class:`R12Spline` is the real 3D support which means the B-spline curve vertices has not to be in a
plane and no hassle with :ref:`UCS` for 3D placing.

R12Spline
=========

DXF R12 supports 2D B-splines, but Autodesk do not document the usage in the DXF Reference. The base entity for splines
in DXF R12 is the POLYLINE entity. The spline itself is always in a plane, but as any 2D entity, the spline can be
transformed into the 3D object by elevation and extrusion (:ref:`OCS`, :ref:`UCS`).

The result is not better than :class:`Spline`, it is also just a POLYLINE entity, but as with all tools, you never
know if someone needs it some day.

Bezier
======

Render a bezier curve as 2D/3D :class:`~ezdxf.entities.Polyline`.

The :class:`Bezier` class is implemented with multiple segments, each segment is an optimized 4 point bezier curve, the
4 control points of the curve are: the start point (1) and the end point (4), point (2) is start point + start vector
and point (3) is end point + end vector. Each segment has its own approximation count.

EulerSpiral
===========

Render an `euler spiral <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_spiral>`_ as 3D :class:`Polyline` or :class:`Spline`.

This is a parametric curve, which always starts at the origin ``(0, 0)``.
