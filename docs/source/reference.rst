Reference
=========

The `DXF Reference`_ is online available at `Autodesk`_.

Quoted from the original DXF 12 Reference which is not available on the web:

   Since the AutoCAD drawing database (.dwg file) is written in a
   compact format that changes significantly as new features are added
   to AutoCAD, we do not document its format and do not recommend that
   you attempt to write programs to read it directly. To assist in
   interchanging drawings between AutoCAD and other programs, a Drawing
   Interchange file format (DXF) has been defined. All implementations
   of AutoCAD accept this format and are able to convert it to and from
   their internal drawing file representation.
