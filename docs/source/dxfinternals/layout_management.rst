Layout Management Structures
============================

Layouts are separated entity spaces, there are three different Layout types:

    1. modelspace contains the 'real' world representation of the drawing subjects in real world units.
    2. paperspace layouts are used to create different drawing sheets of the modelspace subjects for printing or PDF export
    3. Blocks are reusable sets of graphical entities, inserted by the INSERT entity.

All layouts have at least a BLOCK definition in the BLOCKS section and since DXF R13 exists the BLOCK_RECORD table with
an entry for every BLOCK in the BLOCKS section.

.. seealso::

    Information about :ref:`Block Management Structures`


The name of the modelspace BLOCK is ``*Model_Space`` (DXF R12: ``$MODEL_SPACE``) and the name of the `active` paper
space BLOCK is ``*Paper_Space`` (DXF R12: ``$PAPER_SPACE``), the entities of these two layouts are
stored in the ENTITIES section, DXF R12 supports just one paperspace layout.

DXF R13 and later supports multiple paperspace layouts, the `active` layout is still called ``*Paper_Space``, the
additional `inactive` paperspace layouts are named by the scheme ``*Paper_Spacennnn``, where the first inactive paper
space is called ``*Paper_Space0``, the second ``*Paper_Space1`` and so on.
A none consecutive numbering is tolerated by AutoCAD. The content of the inactive paperspace layouts are stored
as BLOCK content in the BLOCKS section. These names are just the DXF internal layout names, each layout has an
additional layout name which is displayed to the user by the CAD application.

A BLOCK definition and a BLOCK_RECORD is not enough for a proper layout setup, an LAYOUT entity in the OBJECTS section
is also required. All LAYOUT entities are managed by a DICTIONARY entity, which is referenced as ``ACAD_LAYOUT`` entity
in the root DICTIONARY of the DXF file.

.. note::

    All floating point values are rounded to 2 decimal places for better readability.


LAYOUT Entiy
------------

Since DXF R2000 modelspace and paperspace layouts require the DXF
`LAYOUT <http://help.autodesk.com/view/OARX/2018/ENU/?guid=GUID-433D25BF-655D-4697-834E-C666EDFD956D>`_ entity.

    1001    <<< extended data (ignore)
    ...

And as it seems this is also not enough for a well defined LAYOUT, at least a "main" VIEWPORT entity with ID=1 is
required for paperspace layouts, located in the entity space of the layout.

The modelspace layout requires (?) a VPORT entity in the VPORT table (group code 331 in the AcDbLayout subclass).

Main VIEWPORT Entity for LAYOUT
-------------------------------

The "main" viewport for layout ``Layout1`` shown above. This viewport is located in the associated BLOCK definition called
``*Paper_Space0``. Group code 330 in subclass AcDbLayout points to the BLOCK_RECORD of ``*Paper_Space0``.
Remember: the entities of the `active` paperspace layout are located in the ENTITIES section, therefore ``Layout1`` is not
the active paperspace layout.

The "main" VIEWPORT describes, how the application shows the paperspace layout on the screen, and I guess only AutoCAD
needs this values. And the most values
