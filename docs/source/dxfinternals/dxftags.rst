DXF Tags
========

A Drawing Interchange File is simply an ASCII text file with a file
type of .dxf and special formatted text. The basic file structure
are DXF tags, a DXF tag consist of a DXF group code as an integer
value on its own line and a the DXF value on the following line.
In the ezdxf documentation DXF tags will be written as :code:`(group code, value)`.

Group codes are indicating the value type:

.. _xdata_internals:

Extended Data
-------------

Extended data (XDATA) is created by AutoLISP or ObjectARX applications but any other application like *ezdxf* can also
define XDATA. If an entity contains extended data, it **follows** the entity's normal definition data but ends
**before** `Embedded Objects`_.

But extended group codes (>=1000) can appear **before** the XDATA section, an example is the BLOCKBASEPOINTPARAMETER
entity in AutoCAD Civil 3D or AutoCAD Map 3D.

================= ===================================================================================
Group Code        Description
================= ===================================================================================
1000              Strings in extended data can be up to 255 bytes long (with the 256th byte reserved
                  for the null character)
1001              (fixed) Registered application name (ASCII string up to 31 bytes long) for XDATA
1002              (fixed) An extended data control string can be either ``'{'`` or ``'}'``.
                  These braces enable applications to organize their data by subdividing
                  the data into lists. Lists can be nested.
1003              Name of the layer associated with the extended data
1004              Binary data is organized into variable-length chunks. The maximum length of each
                  chunk is 127 bytes. In ASCII DXF files, binary data is represented as a string of
                  hexadecimal digits, two per binary byte
1005              Database Handle of entities in the drawing database, see also:
                  :ref:`About 1005 Group Codes`
1010, 1020, 1030  Three real values, in the order X, Y, Z. They can be used as a point or vector
                  record.
1011, 1021, 1031  Unlike a simple 3D point, the world space coordinates are moved, scaled, rotated,
                  mirrored, and stretched along with the parent entity to which the extended data
                  belongs.
1012, 1012, 1022  Also a 3D point that is scaled, rotated, and mirrored along with the parent
                  (but is not moved or stretched)
1013, 1023, 1033  Also a 3D point that is scaled, rotated, and mirrored along with the parent
                  (but is not moved or stretched)
1040              A real value
1041              Distance, a real value that is scaled along with the parent entity
1042              Scale Factor, also a real value that is scaled along with the parent.
                  The difference between a distance and a scale factor is application-defined
1070              A 16-bit integer (signed or unsigned)
1071              A 32-bit signed (long) integer
================= ===================================================================================


The :code:`(1001, ...)` tag indicates the beginning of extended data. In contrast to normal entity data, with extended
data the same group code can appear multiple times, and **order is important**.

Extended data is grouped by registered application name. Each registered application group begins with a
:code:`(1001, APPID)` tag, with the application name as APPID string value. Registered application names correspond to
APPID symbol table entries.

An application can use as many APPID names as needed. APPID names are permanent, although they can be purged if they
aren't currently used in the drawing. Each APPID name can have **no more than one data group** attached to each entity.
Within an application group, the sequence of extended data groups and their meaning is defined by the application.

.. _String Value Encoding:

String value encoding
---------------------

String values stored in a DXF file is plain ASCII or UTF-8, AutoCAD also supports CIF (Common Interchange Format) and MIF
(Maker Interchange Format) encoding. The UTF-8 format is only supported in DXF R2007 and later.

ezdxf on import converts all strings into Python unicode strings without encoding or decoding CIF/MIF.

String values containing Unicode characters are represented with control character sequences ``\U+nnnn``.
(e.g. ``r'TEST\U+7F3A\U+4E4F\U+89E3\U+91CA\U+6B63THIS\U+56FE'``)

To support the DXF unicode encoding ezdxf registers an encoding codec `dxf_backslash_replace`, defined in
:func:`ezdxf.lldxf.encoding`.

String values can be stored with these dxf group codes:

- 0 - 9
- 100 - 101
- 300 - 309
- 410 - 419
- 430 - 439
- 470 - 479
- 999 - 1003

Multi tag text (MTEXT)
----------------------

If the text string is less than 250 characters, all characters appear in tag :code:`(1, ...)`. If the text string is
longer than 250 characters, the string is divided into 250-character chunks, which appear in one or more
:code:`(3, ...)` tags. If :code:`(3, ...)` tags are used, the last group is a :code:`(1, ...)` tag and has fewer than
250 characters:

.. code-block:: none

    3
    ... TwoHundredAndFifty Characters ....
    3
    ... TwoHundredAndFifty Characters ....
    1
    less than TwoHundredAndFifty Characters

As far I know this is only supported by the MTEXT entity.

.. seealso::

    :ref:`DXF File Encoding`

.. _Tag Structure DXF R13 and later:

DXF R13 and later tag structure
-------------------------------

With the introduction of DXF R13 Autodesk added additional group codes and DXF tag structures to the DXF Standard.

Subclass Markers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Subclass markers :code:`(100, Subclass Name)` divides DXF objects into several sections. Group codes can be reused
in different sections. A subclass ends with the following subclass marker or at the beginning of xdata or the end of the
object. See `Subclass Marker Example`_ in the DXF Reference.

Quote about group codes from the DXF reference
----------------------------------------------

    Some group codes that define an entity always appear; others are optional and appear only if their values differ
    from the defaults.

    **Do not** write programs that **rely on the order given here**. The end of an entity is indicated by the next 0
    group, which begins the next entity or indicates the end of the section.

    **Note:** Accommodating DXF files from future releases of AutoCAD will be easier if you write your DXF processing
    program in a table-driven way, ignore undefined group codes, and make no assumptions about the order of group codes
    in an entity. With each new AutoCAD release, new group codes will be added to entities to accommodate additional
    features.

Usage of group codes in subclasses twice
----------------------------------------

Some later entities entities contains the same group code twice for different purposes, so order in the sense of which
one comes first is important. (e.g. ATTDEF group code 280)

Tag order is sometimes important especially for AutoCAD
-------------------------------------------------------

In LWPOLYLINE the order of tags is important, if the `count` tag is not the first tag in the AcDbPolyline subclass,
AutoCAD will not close the polyline when the `close` flag is set, by the way other applications like BricsCAD ignores
the tag order and renders the polyline always correct.

.. _extension_dict_internals:

Extension Dictionary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The extension dictionary is an optional sequence that stores the handle of a DICTIONARY object that belongs to the
current object, which in turn may contain entries. This facility allows attachment of arbitrary database objects to any
database object. Any object or entity may have this section.

The extension dictionary tag sequence:

.. code-block:: none

  102
  {ACAD_XDICTIONARY
  360
  Hard-owner ID/handle to owner dictionary
  102
  }

.. _reactors_internals:

Persistent Reactors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Persistent reactors are an optional sequence that stores object handles of objects registering themselves as reactors on
the current object. Any object or entity may have this section.

The persistent reactors tag sequence:

.. code-block:: none

  102
  {ACAD_REACTORS
  330
  first Soft-pointer ID/handle to owner dictionary
  330
  second Soft-pointer ID/handle to owner dictionary
  ...
  102
  }

.. _app_data_internals:

Application-Defined Codes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting at DXF R13, DXF objects can contain application-defined codes outside of XDATA. This application-defined
codes can contain any tag except :code:`(0, ...)` and :code:`(102, '{...')`. "{YOURAPPID" means the APPID string with an
preceding "{". The application defined data tag sequence:

.. code-block:: none

    102
    {YOURAPPID
    ...
    102
    }

:code:`(102, 'YOURAPPID}')` is also a valid closing tag:

.. code-block:: none

    102
    {YOURAPPID
    ...
    102
    YOURAPPID}

All groups defined with a beginning :code:`(102, ...)` appear in the DXF reference before the first subclass marker,
I don't know if these groups can appear after the first or any subclass marker. ezdxf accepts them at any position,
and by default ezdxf adds new app data in front of the first subclass marker to the first tag section of an DXF object.

**Exception XRECORD:** Tags with group code 102 and a value string without a preceding "{" or the scheme "YOURAPPID}",
should be treated as usual group codes.

.. _embedded_objects_internals:

Embedded Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The concept of embedded objects was introduced with AutoCAD 2018 (DXF version AC1032) and this is the only information
I found about it at the Autodesk knowledge base: `Embedded and Encapsulated Objects`_

Quote from `Embedded and Encapsulated Objects`_:

    For DXF filing, the embedded object must be filed out and in after all the data of the encapsulating object
    has been filed out and in.

    A separator is needed between the encapsulating object's data and the subsequent embedded object's data.
    The separator must be similar in function to the group 0 or 100 in that it must cause the filer to stop
    reading data. The normal DXF group code 0 cannot be used because DXF proxies use it to determine when to
    stop reading data. The group code 100 could have been used, but it might have caused confusion when manually
    reading a DXF file, and there was a need to distinguish when an embedded object is about to be written out in
    order to do some internal bookkeeping. Therefore, the DXF group code 101 was introduced.

**Hard facts:**

- Embedded object start with :code:`(101, "Embedded Object")` tag
- Embedded object is appended to the encapsulated object
- :code:`(101, "Embedded Object")` tag is the end of the encapsulating object, also of its `Extended Data`_
- Embedded object tags can contain any group code except the DXF structure tag :code:`(0, ...)`

**Unconfirmed assumptions:**

- The encapsulating object can contain more than one embedded object.
- Embedded objects separated by :code:`(101, "Embedded Object")` tags
- every entity can contain embedded objects
- XDATA sections replaced by embedded objects, at least for the MTEXT entity

Real world example from an AutoCAD 2018 file:

.. code-block:: none
