DIMVAR              Code     Description
=================== ======= ==============================================================================================
DIMALT              170     Controls the display of alternate units in dimensions.

DIMALTD             171     Controls the number of decimal places in alternate units. If DIMALT is turned on, DIMALTD sets
                            the number of digits displayed to the right of the decimal point in the alternate measurement.

DIMALTF             143     Controls the multiplier for alternate units. If DIMALT is turned on, DIMALTF multiplies linear
                            dimensions by a factor to produce a value in an alternate system of measurement. The initial
                            value represents the number of millimeters in an inch.

DIMAPOST            4       Specifies a text prefix or suffix (or both) to the alternate dimension measurement for all
                            types of dimensions except angular. For instance, if the current units are Architectural,
                            DIMALT is on, DIMALTF is 25.4 (the number of millimeters per inch), DIMALTD is 2, and DIMPOST
                            is set to "mm", a distance of 10 units would be displayed as 10"[254.00mm].

DIMASZ              41      Controls the size of dimension line and leader line arrowheads. Also controls the size of hook
                            lines. Multiples of the arrowhead size determine whether dimension lines and text should fit
                            between the extension lines. DIMASZ is also used to scale arrowhead blocks if set by DIMBLK.
                            DIMASZ has no effect when DIMTSZ is other than zero.

DIMBLK              5       Sets the arrowhead block displayed at the ends of dimension lines.

DIMBLK1             6       Sets the arrowhead for the first end of the dimension line when DIMSAH is 1.

DIMBLK2             7       Sets the arrowhead for the second end of the dimension line when DIMSAH is 1.

DIMCEN              141     Controls drawing of circle or arc center marks and centerlines by the DIMCENTER, DIMDIAMETER,
                            and DIMRADIUS commands.  For DIMDIAMETER and DIMRADIUS, the center mark is drawn only if you
                            place the dimension line outside the circle or arc.

                            - 0 =  No center marks or lines are drawn
                            - <0 = Centerlines are drawn
                            - >0 = Center marks are drawn

DIMCLRD             176     Assigns colors to dimension lines, arrowheads, and dimension leader lines.

                            - 0 =  BYBLOCK
                            - 1-255 = ACI AutoCAD Color Index
                            - 256 =  BYLAYER

DIMCLRE             177     Assigns colors to dimension extension lines, values like DIMCLRD

DIMCLRT             178     Assigns colors to dimension text, values like DIMCLRD

DIMDLE              46      Sets the distance the dimension line extends beyond the extension line when oblique strokes
                            are drawn instead of arrowheads.

DIMDLI              43      Controls the spacing of the dimension lines in baseline dimensions. Each dimension line is
                            offset from the previous one by this amount, if necessary, to avoid drawing over it. Changes
                            made with DIMDLI are not applied to existing dimensions.

DIMEXE              44      Specifies how far to extend the extension line beyond the dimension line.

DIMEXO              42      Specifies how far extension lines are offset from origin points. With fixed-length extension
                            lines, this value determines the minimum offset.

DIMGAP              147     Sets the distance around the dimension text when the dimension line breaks to accommodate
                            dimension text. Also sets the gap between annotation and a hook line created with the LEADER
                            command. If you enter a negative value, DIMGAP places a box around the dimension text.

                            DIMGAP is also used as the minimum length for pieces of the dimension line. When the default
                            position for the dimension text is calculated, text is positioned inside the extension lines
                            only if doing so breaks the dimension lines into two segments at least as long as DIMGAP.
                            Text placed above or below the dimension line is moved inside only if there is room for the
                            arrowheads, dimension text, and a margin between them at least as large as
                            DIMGAP: 2 * (DIMASZ + DIMGAP).

DIMLFAC             144     Sets a scale factor for linear dimension measurements. All linear dimension distances,
                            including radii, diameters, and coordinates, are multiplied by DIMLFAC before being
                            converted to dimension text. Positive values of DIMLFAC are applied to dimensions in both
                            modelspace and paperspace; negative values are applied to paperspace only.

                            DIMLFAC applies primarily to nonassociative dimensions (DIMASSOC set 0 or 1). For
                            nonassociative dimensions in paperspace, DIMLFAC must be set individually for each layout
                            viewport to accommodate viewport scaling.

                            DIMLFAC has no effect on angular dimensions, and is not applied to the values held in
                            DIMRND, DIMTM, or DIMTP.

DIMLIM              72      Generates dimension limits as the default text. Setting DIMLIM to On turns DIMTOL off.

                            - 0 = Dimension limits are not generated as default text
                            - 1 = Dimension limits are generated as default text

DIMPOST             3       Specifies a text prefix or suffix (or both) to the dimension measurement.

                            For example, to establish a suffix for millimeters, set DIMPOST to mm; a distance of 19.2
                            units would be displayed as 19.2 mm. If tolerances are turned on, the suffix is applied to
                            the tolerances as well as to the main dimension.

                            Use "<>" to indicate placement of the text in relation to the dimension value. For example,
                            enter "<>mm" to display a 5.0 millimeter radial dimension as "5.0mm". If you entered mm
                            "<>", the dimension would be displayed as "mm 5.0".

DIMRND              45      Rounds all dimensioning distances to the specified value.

                            For instance, if DIMRND is set to 0.25, all distances round to the nearest 0.25 unit. If you
                            set DIMRND to 1.0, all distances round to the nearest integer. Note that the number of
                            digits edited after the decimal point depends on the precision set by DIMDEC. DIMRND does
                            not apply to angular dimensions.

DIMSAH              173     Controls the display of dimension line arrowhead blocks.

                            - 0 = Use arrowhead blocks set by DIMBLK
                            - 1 = Use arrowhead blocks set by DIMBLK1 and DIMBLK2

DIMSCALE            40      Sets the overall scale factor applied to dimensioning variables that specify sizes,
                            distances, or offsets. Also affects the leader objects with the LEADER command.

                            Use MLEADERSCALE to scale multileader objects created with the MLEADER command.

                            * 0.0 = A reasonable default value is computed based on the scaling between the current model
                              space viewport and paperspace. If you are in paperspace or modelspace and not using the
                              paperspace feature, the scale factor is 1.0.
                            * >0 = A scale factor is computed that leads text sizes, arrowhead sizes, and other scaled
                              distances to plot at their face values.

                            DIMSCALE does not affect measured lengths, coordinates, or angles.

                            Use DIMSCALE to control the overall scale of dimensions. However, if the current dimension
                            style is annotative, DIMSCALE is automatically set to zero and the dimension scale is
                            controlled by the CANNOSCALE system variable. DIMSCALE cannot be set to a non-zero value
                            when using annotative dimensions.

DIMSE1              75      Suppresses display of the first extension line.

                            - 0 = Extension line is not suppressed
                            - 1 = Extension line is suppressed

DIMSE2              76      Suppresses display of the second extension line.

                            - 0 = Extension line is not suppressed
                            - 1 = Extension line is suppressed

DIMSOXD             175     Suppresses arrowheads if not enough space is available inside the extension lines.

                            - 0 = Arrowheads are not suppressed
                            - 1 = Arrowheads are suppressed

                            If not enough space is available inside the extension lines and DIMTIX is on, setting
                            DIMSOXD to On suppresses the arrowheads. If DIMTIX is off, DIMSOXD has no effect.

DIMTAD              77      Controls the vertical position of text in relation to the dimension line.

                            - 0 = Centers the dimension text between the extension lines.
                            - 1 = Places the dimension text above the dimension line except when the dimension line is not
                              horizontal and text inside the extension lines is forced horizontal (DIMTIH = 1). The
                              distance from the dimension line to the baseline of the lowest line of text is the current
                              DIMGAP value.
                            - 2 = Places the dimension text on the side of the dimension line farthest away from the
                              defining points.
                            - 3 = Places the dimension text to conform to Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS).
                            - 4 = Places the dimension text below the dimension line.

DIMTFAC             146     Specifies a scale factor for the text height of fractions and tolerance values relative to
                            the dimension text height, as set by DIMTXT.

                            For example, if DIMTFAC is set to 1.0, the text height of fractions and tolerances is the
                            same height as the dimension text. If DIMTFAC is set to 0.7500, the text height of fractions
                            and tolerances is three-quarters the size of dimension text.

DIMTIH              73      Controls the position of dimension text inside the extension lines for all dimension types
                            except Ordinate.

                            - 0 = Aligns text with the dimension line
                            - 1 = Draws text horizontally

DIMTIX              174     Draws text between extension lines.

                            - 0 = Varies with the type of dimension. For linear and angular dimensions, text is placed
                              inside the extension lines if there is sufficient room. For radius and diameter dimensions
                              hat don’t fit inside the circle or arc, DIMTIX has no effect and always forces the text
                              outside the circle or arc.
                            - 1 = Draws dimension text between the extension lines even if it would ordinarily be placed
                              outside those lines

DIMTM               48      Sets the minimum (or lower) tolerance limit for dimension text when DIMTOL or DIMLIM is on.
                            DIMTM accepts signed values. If DIMTOL is on and DIMTP and DIMTM are set to the same value,
                            a tolerance value is drawn. If DIMTM and DIMTP values differ, the upper tolerance is drawn
                            above the lower, and a plus sign is added to the DIMTP value if it is positive. For DIMTM,
                            the program uses the negative of the value you enter (adding a minus sign if you specify a
                            positive number and a plus sign if you specify a negative number).

DIMTOFL             172     Controls whether a dimension line is drawn between the extension lines even when the text
                            is placed outside. For radius and diameter dimensions (when DIMTIX is off), draws a
                            dimension line inside the circle or arc and places the text, arrowheads, and leader outside.

                            - 0 = Does not draw dimension lines between the measured points when arrowheads are placed
                              outside the measured points
                            - 1 = Draws dimension lines between the measured points even when arrowheads are placed
                              outside the measured points

DIMTOH              74      Controls the position of dimension text outside the extension lines.

                            - 0 = Aligns text with the dimension line
                            - 1 = Draws text horizontally

DIMTOL              71      Appends tolerances to dimension text. Setting DIMTOL to on turns DIMLIM off.

DIMTP               47      Sets the maximum (or upper) tolerance limit for dimension text when DIMTOL or DIMLIM is on.
                            DIMTP accepts signed values. If DIMTOL is on and DIMTP and DIMTM are set to the same value,
                            a tolerance value is drawn. If DIMTM and DIMTP values differ, the upper tolerance is drawn
                            above the lower and a plus sign is added to the DIMTP value if it is positive.

DIMTSZ              142     Specifies the size of oblique strokes drawn instead of arrowheads for linear, radius, and
                            diameter dimensioning.

                            - 0 = Draws arrowheads.
                            - >0 = Draws oblique strokes instead of arrowheads. The size of the oblique strokes is
                              determined by this value multiplied by the DIMSCALE value

DIMTVP              145     Controls the vertical position of dimension text above or below the dimension line. The
                            DIMTVP value is used when DIMTAD = 0. The magnitude of the vertical offset of text is
                            the product of the text height and DIMTVP. Setting DIMTVP to 1.0 is equivalent to setting
                            DIMTAD = 1. The dimension line splits to accommodate the text only if the absolute value
                            of DIMTVP is less than 0.7.

DIMTXT              140     Specifies the height of dimension text, unless the current text style has a fixed height.

DIMZIN              78      Controls the suppression of zeros in the primary unit value. Values 0-3 affect
                            feet-and-inch dimensions only:

                            - 0 = Suppresses zero feet and precisely zero inches
                            - 1 = Includes zero feet and precisely zero inches
                            - 2 = Includes zero feet and suppresses zero inches
                            - 3 = Includes zero inches and suppresses zero feet
                            - 4 (Bit 3) = Suppresses leading zeros in decimal dimensions (for example, 0.5000 becomes .5000)
                            - 8 (Bit 4) = Suppresses trailing zeros in decimal dimensions (for example, 12.5000 becomes 12.5)
                            - 12 (Bit 3+4) = Suppresses both leading and trailing zeros (for example, 0.5000 becomes .5)
