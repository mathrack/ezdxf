XRecord
=======

.. module:: ezdxf.entities
    :noindex:

Important class for storing application defined data in DXF files.

`XRECORD`_ objects are used to store and manage arbitrary data. They are composed of DXF group codes ranging
from ``1`` through ``369``. This object is similar in concept to XDATA but is not limited by size or order.

To reference a XRECORD by an DXF entity, store the handle of the XRECORD in the XDATA section, application defined data
or the :class:`ExtensionDict` of the DXF entity.
